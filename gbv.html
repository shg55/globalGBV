							<h2 style="color:#fec503;">Activism Efforts</h2>
							<p style="text-align:center;"> The 21st Century is making everyone more aware of gender-based violence (GBV). Protests have erupted throughout the world, demanding justice for victims of GBV. For example, the #TotalShutDown protest in South Africa urges every human to realize that "her body is not your crime scene." Furthermore, female empowerment is also being encouraged in the battle against GBV. In Rwanda and in Delhi, gender desks have been created and run by women 24 hours every day in order to help victims of GBV within police stations. These measures have fostered security and safety, according to <a href="https://www.un.org/africarenewal/taxonomy/term/112">Mary Kimani</a>, a journalist for Online AfricaRenewal. Laws are being reformed as well. The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women persuades governments to change discriminatory practices and laws like early marriage. Furthermore, the Africa-UNiTE campaign aims to end GBV in Africa and pushes governments to make legislation against GBV. Schools, universities, and private companies have started to educate their people about the repercussions of gender discrimination and sexual harassment in Africa. A significant organization that famous for fighting to stop violence against women is known as CARE. It has worked in 93 countries, reaching 63 million people through 950 poverty-fighting development and humanitarian aid programs, according to its <a href="https://www.care.org/">website.</a></p>

						<h2 style="margin:20px;">FAST FACTS</h2> 
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>45.6% of African women 15 years or older experienced physical or sexual violence or both.</li>
  <li>56% of Tanzanian women and 71% of Ethiopian women have faced some form of violence by their intimate partners.</li>
  <li>A South African woman is killed by an intimate partner every 6 hours.</li>
  <li>The sexual offense rate of women in South Africa increased by 53% in 2017.</li>
  <li>3 women die at the hands of their partners every day in South Africa due to gender-based violence.</li>
  <li>In South Africa, femicide in 2015 was 9.6%, four times higher than the global rate of 2.4 per 100,000 women. </li>
  <li>In 2017, an average of 109.1 rapes was recorded every day in South Africa.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many factors cause gender-based violence in Africa, such as a lack of education and child maltreatment. Women are not equipped to handle these dire situations, in turn hurting their mental, physical, sexual, and reproductive health. In fact, women who face gender-based violence are twice as likely to be depressed, abuse alcohol, have human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, in order to prove that a man has committed gender-based violence in Africa, a victim must show hard-evidence of the violence, or else police officers will not shed a glance at the victim. The fear of facing a police officer has led many women to keep their stories a secret. Furthermore, a high possibility of being raped by police officers, who are meant to protect their people, is not uncommon in poor African countries, according to Mary Wandia, a Kenyan gender advocate.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="modal-body">
						<h2 style="margin:20px;">FAST FACTS</h2> 
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>A 2010 study in New Delhi showed that 66% of women have reported sexual harassment between two and five times in 2009.</li>
  <li>Over the past decade, 2.24 million crimes against women were reported in India alone. This means that 26 crimes are reported every hour or one per two minutes.</li>
  <li>In a study of 143 gender-based violence survivors, 56% of Filipinas and 64% Indian and Pakistani women said that they experienced some form of sexual violence.</li>
  <li>In 2014 and 2015, close to 54% of all abductions of women were carried out to force them into marriage and unwanted pregnancies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important to realize that it is difficult for women to speak up against crime, as they will be subjected to social isolation and scorn. Similar to African police officers, many Asian police officers choose not to register a woman&#39;s complaint. In Asia, the idea of familial ties is stressed: this means that there are more reports of domestic, family violence. In fact, the top explanations behind domestic violence are that the husband wants to assert his dominance so that he can have more power and control. Additionally, Asian cultures heavily portray women to be calm, patient, and feminine. What this means, unfortunately, is that women are assumed to be an easy target for men to take their anger out on.</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>41% of women have experienced physical abuse and 10% have experienced sexual violence at the hands of their partners, according to a 2004-2005 Peru study.</li>
  <li>18% of girls in the Caribbean have been sexually abused before the age of 16.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Latin America is home to the underlying issues of gender-based violence. 14 out of 25 countries in Latin America have the highest rates of femicide in the world. Laws and practices to convict perpetrators of gender-based violence are very weak as the patriarchal system continues to exist in high poverty and crime areas. Moreover, the drug wars have made femicide and gender-based violence rates much higher, as dangerous gangs rape women who do not give them the drugs they want. This, unfortunately, is used as a tactic to scare other gangs or initiate men into their gang. </p>
